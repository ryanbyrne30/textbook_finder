# ⚠️ For Educational Purposes Only
I do not condone the use of piracy nor do I wish to undervalue the education system. Can there be improvements to such a matter... yes, but this is not a solution to that. This is an experimental project and case study to see how one may go about finding educational resources online. What you do with this knowledge is up to you. I am not liable.

# What is this?
This is a program to find textbooks online based on the curriculum of a school. Why pay $80,000 a year for an institution to give you a curiculum and make you pay even more for textbooks and have you study on your own anyway 
when there's even more information of the internet?

This project currently only uses the curriculums found on Boston College's website.

# How to Run
1. Have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed
2. Run the script:
```
python3 main.py
```
3. Voila, a materials.json file will be generated for the math curiculum of BC
